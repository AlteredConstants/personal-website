          Copyright is a tricky subject. While I fully support the original purpose of copyright
          law—to incentivize authors and inventors to create more to share—I am disappointed in what
          it has become.

          And while I fully respect everyone's individual right to choose how best to share their
          works and make a living, I must abstain from "business as usual". If someone sees value in
          what I share and thinks they can improve upon (or make money from) my work, they have my
          blessing. I hope that my contribution to the inherently collaborative process of human
          expression and knowledge helps inspire others to join in.

          However, in order to promote my ideals, I retain all rights provided by US and
          international copyright law. Counter-intuitive as it might seem, this is a requirement for
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a>" licensing.

            † Yes, optional requirements. I can't explicitly enforce these through the license and
            I'm not sure I would in any case, but they are in keeping with my ideals of
            collaborative creation.
